	Welcome to part four of the front end development course!
	---------------------------------------------------------
	You have learned to build a webpage with HTML and CSS, and to make it interactive with Javascript. You have all the tools you need to make a fully functional website - and that’s 
	awesome! But you might be asking - where do I go from here? In this course we are going to cover some tools that will take your front end web development skills to a professional 
	level. We will focus on a build tool called Webpack and let it take us on a tour through all the most common technologies and strategies you’ll see in a professional front end 
	project.

	This course is really about a mental shift. Up to this point we have built toy apps for the purpose of learning that typically only have one user - us. But how does our 
	development need to change in order to build, say, a large company website with a whole team of devs? We’re going to explore that and a whole lot more in the coming modules.

	Lesson Objectives
	-----------------
	The prime objectives of this first lesson are:

	1. To set up the context of why we need build-tools for front end development.
	2. To understand how any build tool uses a configuration file where all the app development rules are defined.

	Baseline Questions
	------------------
	Have you ever used build tools in a project?

	Your reflection
	---------------
	Yes.

	Baseline Questions
	------------------
	As you start this course, what is your current understanding of build tools (if any)? What are they? What are they for/what do they do?

	Your reflection
	---------------
	Build tools are pieces of software created for standarizing the development process and their purpose is to help in different task such as bundling files, transpiling code, 
	translating between different versions of JavaScript in order to make the development process more efficient.

	Baseline Questions
	------------------
	As you start this course, what is your current understanding of Webpack (if any)? Feel free to throw out even bits and pieces if you can't think of a full description. Things like 
	where is Webpack used, what it does, other technologies that use it, etc..

	Your reflection	
	---------------
	Webpack is a tool that helps to build a bundled set of files ready for production. I know that this is integrated in some tools used to create react apps, such as npx 
	create-react-app.

	Interview Question
	------------------
	Tell me about one tool you have used that improved your frontend workflow and why. This could be anything from a text editor plugin, linter, time tracker, etc... whatever you l
	ike.

	Your reflection	
	---------------
	I use a lot of extensions in visual studio code, such as Auto Close Tag extension and other tools such as npx create-react-app or Next.js.

	Things to think about
	---------------------
	Good job! Feel free to try these interview questions as often as you want, the more practice the better.
